# Q-Learning-TicTacToe
My implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm in the game TicTacToe.

I tested it against the google bot on medium difficulty and my model won.
Against the impossible difficulty its is always a tie.

It took over 100 millions games to train against another bot from scratch and then a few more games against itself.
I used the "table_inversion.py" to mirror the model.

# You can play against it! Try not to lose :)
Just put the files "q_table.pickle" and "tictactoegame.py" in the same directory and run the script!

Have fun!
